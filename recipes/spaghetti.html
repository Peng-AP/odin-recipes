    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A classic Roman dish that uses just a few pantry staples: spaghetti, garlic, olive oil, and chili flakes. It’s quick, cheap, and incredibly flavorful.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g (7 oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>3–4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>    
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley (optional), chopped</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan (optional)</li>
    </ul>   
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté until garlic is golden, not burned.</li>
        <li>Add the drained spaghetti to the pan, along with a bit of the reserved pasta water. Toss well to coat.</li>
        <li>Cook for another minute, allowing the starch and oil to emulsify.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped parsley and Parmesan (if using). Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
